                This stress test uses the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), which is a widely used psychological tool for
                measuring the degree to which situations in your life are perceived as stressful.
                <br /> <br />
                The questions tap into how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded you feel your life is. They are
                also general and direct, making them relatively free from bias. The questions in the PSS ask about
                feelings and thoughts during the last month. In each case, you are asked how often you felt a certain
                way.
